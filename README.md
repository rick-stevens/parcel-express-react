# parcel-node

Parcel starter-kit with React, React Router, ReactStrap, PostCSS and Airbnb ESLint through a Node express server containing an API endpoint example.

## Install

You'll need Node `>=10` (to support native import/export syntax).

```shell
npm install
```

## Run

```shell
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:1234.

## Deploy

Just deploy the entire repo to a Node web server environment, like Heroku. `npm start` will boot up Express, serving the production build (when `process.env.NODE_ENV` equals `production`).
