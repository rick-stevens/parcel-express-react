# parcel-node

Parcel starter-kit with React, React Router, ReactStrap, PostCSS and Airbnb ESLint, through an Express server.

## Install

```shell
npm install
```

## Develop

```shell
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:1234. All files (except those in `/src/server`) will hot reload when edited.

## Deploy

Just deploy the entire repo to a Node web server environment, like Heroku. `npm start` will boot up Express, serving the production build (when `process.env.NODE_ENV` equals `production`).
